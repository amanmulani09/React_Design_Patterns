Welcome to the React Design Patterns Collection! This repository contains a curated collection of design patterns commonly used in React applications. Design patterns are proven solutions to common problems that help organize code and make it easier to understand.

## Available Design Patterns

1. [Render Props Pattern]: Learn how to share code between components using the render props pattern. âœ…

2. [Hooks Pattern]: Understand how to use React hooks to manage state and side effects. âœ…

3. [HOC (Higher-Order Component) Pattern]: Explore how to create higher-order components for code reuse.

4. [Context API Pattern]: Learn how to manage global state with the Context API.

5. [Component Composition Pattern]: Discover techniques for building complex UIs through component composition.

## Usage

Each design pattern is documented in its respective markdown file under the `src/Design Patterns` directory. To use a specific design pattern in your React project, follow the code examples and integrate them into your components as needed.
